# Fake News Detection

In this project, we have proposed an ensemble classification model for detection of the fake news that has achieved a better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. 

The proposed model extracts important features from the fake news datasets, and the extracted features are then classified using the ensemble model comprising of two popular machine learning models namely, Random Forest and KNN.
